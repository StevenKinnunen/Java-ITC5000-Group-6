A team class project for ITC5000. 

Contributors: Mariana Betancourt, Steven Kinnunen, Sandra Maldonado, Muhammad Yousaf Malik, Umar Mohammad and Henry Wang

As per instructions defined by Professor Nihad Al-Juboori for Humber's ITC5000 class, this program will do the following:

1. (Steve) When the program starts, a welcoming message will appear “Welcome in Humber College” 

2. (Sandra) Allow the user to login using a password. The password must satisfy the following rules:
 • Should not be less than 10 characters. 
• Should contain at least one upper case letter. 
• Should contain two or three numbers. 
• Should contain one special character. 
If the password is incorrect, the system must ask the user to enter a new password. The system must allow the user only three attempts. If the password is correct, the system will continue.

3. (Mariana) After password checking, the system must ask the user to enter the number of students, the number must be between 1-50. If the user enters any other number, the system must inform the user to enter a correct number (i.e., between 1-50). The system must allow the user only three attempts otherwise the program will stop.

4. (Steve) After the above step (i.e., after entering a valid number), the system must ask the user to enter the names of students. 

5. (Umar) Then, the system must prompt the user to enter the grades of the courses of each student as follows: 
a- “Input your mark in Math” Credit hours = 4 
b- “Input your mark in Science” Credit hours = 5 
c- “Input your mark in Language” Credit hours = 4 
d- “Input your mark in Drama” Credit hours = 3 
e- “Input your mark in Music” Credit hours = 2 
f- “Input your mark in Biology” Credit hours = 4

6. [Malik] The system must calculate the GPA of each student based on the grades that were entered in the previous step according to the following function: 
GPA= ∑ (Mark * Credit hours)/total credit hours

7. [Henry] The system must assign students to schools based on the following matrix:  
School of Engineering: 90 >= GPA <=100 
School of Business: 80>= GPA <90 
Law School: 70 >= GPA <80 
Not accepted: GPA <70

8. (Steve) The system must be able to print the following: 
a- Report 1: Student Name, School Name
b- Report 2: Number of accepted students in Humber college showing students distribution per each school. 
c- Report 3: Number of students that are not accepted. 
d- Report 4: As a program, think of another report that you can add to your list.
